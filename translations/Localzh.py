<br />
Tip, If you are scribing a certain item but it does not complete (you do not get experience and no materials are used) the processing stack is full (250 of each item is max). To fix the issue, go to the processor and process the items you wanted to craft + wait until they are done. Then you can scribe your items. Keep in mind that you need to have the "edit assembly queue" guild permission in oder to be able to do this. Alternatively you can ask your guild leader (or someone with this permission) to do it for you. <br />
<br />
<strong>Guild unlocks</strong><br />
Most of the items the guide recommends you to scribe are guild unlocked recipes (see below for a list + alternatives). Your guild needs to have these unlocked before you can see them as recipes and scribe them. If your guild does not have them unlocked yet, you temporarily join another guild (for example “The rising falcons [RiFa]”, see below) that has the unlocks and scribe them in their hall.  <br />
<br />
<strong>Decoration crafting, required guild permissions and tips</strong><br />
The guide shows you the cheapest way to level up. Due to the recipes it is not likely decorations will be included, However if they are, OR if you want to level up through crafting decorations, you will need the following permissions form your guild leader to do so:<br />
- Use placeable (so you use decorations that the guild has for scribing)<br />
- edit assembly queue (so you can finish the decoration by adding it in the processor after which you can, depending on the decoration, also use it again for scribing at a higher level)<br />
After scribing your decorations, go to the processor (near the crafting stations in both halls) and queue the decorations you just crafted to complete them (takes 30 sec / item).<br />
<strong>Some additional decoration crafting tips:</strong><br />
1 You can buy basic decorations at the decorations vendor for 24 silver each if your guild has it unlocked. You can always buy them at the master scribe for 50 silver each (even if your guild does not have any decoration vendor unlocked).<br />
2 Some basic decorations can only be obtained from the guild trader (guild trader 4 or higher) for guild commendations.  <br />
3 some basic decorations can only be obtained from the decoration trader during certain in game events, for example snow piles from wintersday, pumpkins from Halloween, red lanterns from lunar new year, furniture coins to buy super cloud from SAB festival OR drops from bosses (basically for all the bronze, silver and gold trophies).<br />
<br />
<strong>Guild unlock List and alternatives for each scribe level range:</strong><br />
The guide will always show you the cheapest option. However, it could be that you lack that unlock in your guild but have another one that you could use instead. See this list for alternatives at each crafting level.<br />

<strong>My guild lacks the unlocks/will not give me permissions to level up my scribe</strong><br />
If your guild is missing the guild unlocks (and alternatives) you can “visit” (temporarily join) a guild that has them unlocked so you can level your scribe in their hall. Just keep in mind that all the guild related itmes (banners, WvW items and decorations) that your craft in that guild hall, will stay in the guildhall that you are visiting.<br />
<br />
<p><strong>RiFa appears to be defunct, you should use a guild listed at the beginning of this page.</strong></p><s>
<strong>The Rising Falcons[RiFa] and the scribe guide History</strong><br />
Ever since <strong>Vin Lady Venture</strong> made the first static (now outdated) scribe together with <strong>Dulfy</strong> and found out that the guild unlocked scribe recipes could help leveling scribes safe a lot of gold  He opened up the guild “The rising Falcons[RiFa]” for scribes who wanted to level up and RiFa has continued to run this service ever since. While the original guide has now been replaced by the much more advanced and up to date guide that you see here, made by <strong>xanthic.9478</strong>, RiFa is still accepting scribes who do not have access to (all of) the guild unlocked recipes. It is a casual relaxed guild that offers this service to anyone who likes to level his/her scribe, free of charge. While RiFa is an EU based guild, US based players can also use the service and unlocks. The only thing is that you cannot see any of the main guild members.<br />
<br />
You can send an in game mail to  <strong>Vin lady venture (Rin of Rivvinda.4971)</strong> for an invite in RiFa, just make sure you have at least 1 free guild slot and you should be invited within 24 hours.  <br /></s>

Sub parts are chosen to be made if they are cheaper than buying the part, or they increase the xp/cost ratio more than buying the part.
